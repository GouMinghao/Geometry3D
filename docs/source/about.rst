About Geometry3D
================

Geometry3D is a simple python computational geographics library written in python.
This library focuses on the functions and lacks efficiency which might be improved in future version.


Core Features
-------------
- Basic 3D Geometries: Point, Line, Plane, Segment, Convex Polygon and Convex Polyhedron.
- Simple Object like Cubic, Sphere, Cylinder, Cone, Rectangle, Parallepiped, Parallogram and Circle.  
- Basic Attributes Of Geometries: length, area, volume.
- Basic Relationships And Operations Between Geometries: move, angle, parallel, orthogonal, intersection.
- Overload Build-In Functions Such As `__contains__`, `__hash__`, `__eq__`, `__neg__`.
- A Naive Visualizer Using `matplotlib`.
